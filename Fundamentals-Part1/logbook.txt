Space, the final frontier
These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise
Its five year mission
To explore strange new worlds
To seek out new life
And new civilizations
To boldly go where no man has gone before

This is my first day in my journey to become a FullStack developer, so I decided to start learn JS again, back to 2017/2018 I was in the high school and I learned JS, but I just used in the school. I want to become a fullstack developer, so for this reason I will need to learn this powerful language! I started today a course in Udemy, I already know everything that I watched today, I decided to start from zero so I decided to recap everything that I know about JS. I don't think I'll regret it cause I will learn every base fundamental, that is really important!!! So let's go.
